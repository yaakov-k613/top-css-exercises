    <!-- The properties you need to add to each element are:
    * Make the element with both the `avatar` and `proportioned` 
        classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it retains its original square proportions 
        (don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).
    * Make the element with both the `avatar` and `distorted` 
        classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big as its width 
        (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).

    ## Desired Outcome

    ### Self Check
    - Did you properly chain class selectors for each rule?
    - Does the `proportioned` image retain its original square proportions?
    - Does the `distorted` image end up looking squished and, well, distorted? -->
